# üíß IoT-Based Water Level Monitoring System

## üìò Project Overview

This project implements a smart **IoT-Based Water Level Monitoring System** using an **ESP32** microcontroller and an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor**. It is designed to:

- Monitor water levels in a tank
- Display levels on an LCD
- Provide visual (LEDs) and audio (buzzer) alerts
- Transmit data to **ThingSpeak** for cloud-based remote monitoring

## üíª Functional Highlights

- **Ultrasonic sensor** measures distance from tank top to water.
- **LEDs** indicate the water level:
  - Green ‚Üí Full
  - Yellow ‚Üí Normal
  - Red ‚Üí Low
- **Buzzer** activates during overflow.
- **LCD display** shows real-time water status.
- **Wi-Fi enabled ESP32** uploads data to **ThingSpeak** every 2 seconds.
